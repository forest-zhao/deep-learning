# deep-learning



Deep learning project 1 is to accomplish a multi-class classification task on a dataset. The Multilayer Neural Network should includes more than one hidden layer, ReLU
activation, Momentum in SGD, Dropout, Softmax and cross-entropy loss, Weight
normalization, Mini-batch training. In this project, any deep learning frameworks or any
kinds of auto-grad tools are not allowed to use. The projectâ€™s aim is to experiment and
combine different optimization techniques to achieve the best performance.


Deep learning project 2 is to accomplish a multi-class classification task on handwritten
alphanumeric images. The project is done with a CNN network. The aim is to
experiment different architectures and optimization techniques to achieve the best
performance
